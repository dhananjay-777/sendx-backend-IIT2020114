# Web Crawling Application


The Web Crawler Application allows users to enter a URL and access the crawled content. It gives priority to premium customers, providing both real-time and cached crawling options.

## URL and Query Parameters

- **URL**: This is where you enter the URL you want to crawl.

- **Customer Status**: Paid/Unpaid.




## Features

-**Real-time Crawling:** This feature retrieves and provides page content immediately if the URL hasn't been crawled within the past 60 minutes.

-**Caching System:** Our application stores crawled pages on disk. If a page has been crawled within the last 60 minutes, it serves the cached content, significantly reducing response time and server load.

-**Concurrent Crawling:** Multiple crawler workers can simultaneously crawl pages, improving overall efficiency. Paying customers enjoy priority access and are assigned additional workers to expedite their requests.
